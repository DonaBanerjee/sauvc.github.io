        <p class="type-title">Competition</p>
        <p class="type-content">Autonomous underwater robotics is an exciting challenge in engineering, which students get to experience at SAUVC. The competition is great learning ground for students to experience the challenges of AUV system engineering and develop skills in the related fields of mechanical, electrical and software engineering.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="type-title">Mentorship</p>
        <p class="type-content">Students will have access to mentors and support. Teams will be assigned liasons who will be able to provide mentorship and technical guidance as the teams work on designing and building their AUVs. SAUVC emphasises outreach, learning and skill development and we want to ensure everyone learns and grows through the course of SAUVC.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="type-title">Guest speakers</p>
        <p class="type-content">The competition will also feature workshops and lectures from world renowned experts in the field of marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems to inspire students with new ideas and techniques to solve challenges and build an interest in careers related to marine robotics.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="type-title">Get-Together</p>
        <p class="type-content">The competition is also about meeting others like us, who are also interested in underwater robotics and autonomous systems, to get to know one another, to share ideas and make connections.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <section id="competition">
    <h2>Competition</h2>
    <p>The SAUVC competition challenges student teams to build an AUV which can perform given tasks. These tasks are simulations of tasks operational AUVs would have to be able to perform. The competition is held in a swimming pool and each team's AUV will have to perform 4 tasks. The speed and accuracy at which the AUV performs tasks will be used to decide the winner of the competition</p>
    <p>The tasks involve common but very widely used technqiues such as <span class="highlight">underwater navigation</span>, <span class="highlight">underwater visual indentification</span>, <span class="highlight">underwater acoustic localization</span> and <span class="highlight">robotic manipulation of objects underwater</span>.</p>
    <p>Detailed explaination of the various tasks of the competition and rules are in the <a href="https://sauvc.github.io/rulebook/">Rulebook</a>.</p>
    <p>The competition is open to students from all over the world. A team may consist of up to 8 participants. At least half of the participants must be students at the time of registration.</p>

        <p class="type-title">Getting to Singapore</p>
        <p class="type-content">Singapore is one of Southeast Asia's largest aviation hubs, so unless you're coming from Peninsular Malaysia or Batam/Bintan in Indonesia, the easiest way to enter Singapore is by air. In addition to Singapore Airlines and SilkAir, Singapore is also home to low-cost carriers Tiger Airways, Jetstar Asia. In addition to the locals, every carrier of any size in Asia offers flights to Singapore, with Air Asia and Firefly operating dense networks from Singapore.</p>

      <li>
        <p class="type-title">Immigration</p>
        <p class="type-content">Most nationalities can enter Singapore without a visa. Refer to the <a href="http://www.ica.gov.sg/services_centre_overview.aspx?pageid=252&secid=165">Immigration and Checkpoints Authority</a> for current guidelines. Entry permit duration depends on nationality and entry point. Most people get 14 or 30 days, although EU, Norwegian, Swiss and U passport holders get 90 days. Citizens of some CIS countries (eg: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan) can transit 4 days without a visa, if they have tickets to a third country.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
        <p class="type-title">Get Around</p>
        <p class="type-content">Getting around Singapore is easy. The public transportation system is extremely easy to use and taxis are reasonably priced. All public transport systems in Singapore use the EZ-link contactless RFID farecard or a Nets Flash Pay card. You can store value on it and use it on trains (MRT) and city buses. The card can be bought at MRT stations can be "topped up" in increments at the farecard vending machines or 7-Eleven stores. Taxis use meters and are reasonably priced and honest. Mobile apps like <a href="http://uber.com/">Uber</a> and <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/taxi/">Grab</a> are handy in getting Taxis.</p>

        <p class="type-title">Accomodation</p>
        <p class="type-content">Accommodation in Singapore is expensive by South-East Asian standards. Backpackers' hostels can be found primarily in Little India, Chinatown, Bugis, Clarke Quay and the East Coast at about $25-40 for a dorm bed. Some hostels will rent out whole rooms. Alternatively, the entire dorm room (4 or more beds) can be booked. This provides space for equipment.
